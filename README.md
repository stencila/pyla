## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated

This project is deprecated and no longer maintained. At the time of writing, we are instead focussing on using [`tree-sitter`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) for sematic analysis, and [`ipykernel`](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel) for execution, of Python code. Please see, our main repository, [`stencila/stencila`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila) for further information.

## üì¶ Install

Pyla is available as a Python package,

```bash
pip3 install stencila-pyla
```

## ‚ö° Use

Register Pyla so that it can be discovered by other executors on your machine, 

```bash
python3 -m stencila.pyla register
```

Then, if you have [`executa`](https://github.com/stencila/executa) installed then you can run it using the `repl` command and specifying `python` as the starting language,

```bash
executa repl python
```

## ‚öíÔ∏è Develop

### Setup

To install the packages needed for development, run `make setup` or,

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Code formatting

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to maintain a consistent code formatting style. To run it use `black .` or `make format`.

### Running

There are two options to run the interpreter without installing this package (which can be useful when developing).

#### Use `setup.py develop`

Run `python3 setup.py develop` which will link this library into your site packages directory. You can then execute
documents with the above command.


#### Change into `stencila` folder

You can run the interpreter as a module by changing into the `stencila` directory first, and then omitting the
`stencila` namespace:

```bash
$ cd stencila
$ python3 -m pyla execute <inputfile> <outputfile> [parameters]
```
